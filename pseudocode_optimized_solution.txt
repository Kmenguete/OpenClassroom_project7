optimized solution algorithm
start
dataframe = csv file
dataframe with real profit = another csv file(the algorithm will work with this file)
the real profit represent the percentage of the cost of each share in absolute value.

Function sort_shares_list_by_real_profit(shares)
    sort the 10% most profitable shares according their real profit in descending order
    get_500_euros_shares_list(sorted_shares_by_real_profit)

Function get_real_profit_of_share(shares, index)
    return the real profit of a share

Function get_total_price_of_shares(shares)
    return the total price of shares from a shares list

Function get_total_real_profit_of_shares(shares)
    return the total real profit of shares from a shares list

Function get_real_profit(shares, csv_shares_real_profit)
    real profit[1000] : float real profit number
    for i = 0; i < number of shares; i = i + 1:
        calculate the real profit of shares list and put the result in another csv file.
        shares is the main csv file without real profit data and csv_shares_real_profit is the file that will
        contain the result.
        real profit = price of share x (profit of share/100)
        I add the real profit to the real profit array.
    add_column_in_csv(shares, csv_shares_real_profit, real_profit_list)

Function add_column_in_csv(input_file, output_file, real_profit_list)
    I take the dataframe as input file from which I will add real profit data.
    The output file is the csv file to which I will store and save real profit data.
    The real profit list is the array where I store real profit data(retrieved from get_real_profit function).

Function get_most_profitable_shares(shares)
    Among 1000 shares, I select the 10% of shares with the highest real profit.
    minimum real profit amount = the minimum real profit a share should have in order to be in the top 10% most
    profitable shares list.
    most profitable shares list[100] = dataframe with the 100 most profitable shares among 1000 shares.
    for i = 0; i < number of shares; i = i + 1:
        real profit of share = get_real_profit_of_share(shares, i)
        if real profit of share is greater or equal to minimum real profit amount:
