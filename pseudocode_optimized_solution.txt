optimized solution algorithm
start
dataframe = csv file
dataframe with real profit = another csv file(the algorithm will work with this file)
the real profit represent the percentage of the cost of each share in absolute value.

Function sort_shares_list_by_real_profit(shares)
    sort the 10% most profitable shares according their real profit in descending order
    get_500_euros_shares_list(sorted_shares_by_real_profit)

Function get_real_profit_of_share(shares, index)
    return the real profit of a share

Function get_total_price_of_shares(shares)
    return the total price of shares from a shares list

Function get_total_real_profit_of_shares(shares)
    return the total real profit of shares from a shares list

Function get_real_profit(shares, csv_shares_real_profit)
    calculate the real profit of shares list and put the result in another csv file.
    shares is the main csv file without real profit data and csv_shares_real_profit is the file that will
    contain the result.
    real profit = price of share x (profit of share/100)
